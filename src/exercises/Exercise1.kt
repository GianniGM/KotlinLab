     * Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).
     *
     * Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.
     * The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).
     *
     *   Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by
     *   replacing each nucleotide with its complement:
     *
     *   G -> C
     *   C -> G
     *   T -> A
     *   A -> U
